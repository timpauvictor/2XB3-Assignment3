Design Decisions: Since cities can have multiple possible zip codes, I used the first occurence of a valid State,City as that nodes zip code. Cities like New York City that have multiple 
					states, i used the first state given in the connected cities.

3.1) The graph will be a weighted undirected graph where the nodes are each city and the edges would be a path between cities. Once the initial graph is created, we can use either the DFS or BFS to find the shortest path between the cities.
